# Machine Tool Replacement Model


## Overview

The Machine Tool Replacement Model is a project aimed at developing a predictive model for determining the optimal time to replace machine tools in a manufacturing setup. The project utilizes historical data on machine performance and maintenance to forecast when a machine is likely to fail or become inefficient, enabling manufacturing managers to plan for timely replacements, reduce downtime, and optimize maintenance costs.

## Key Features

- **Predictive Model:** The core of the project is a predictive model that analyzes historical machine performance data to forecast when a machine is likely to fail or require replacement.

- **Data Processing:** The project includes data processing scripts that clean and prepare the input data for the machine learning model.

- **Visualization:** Various data visualization techniques have been implemented to gain insights from the data and model results.

- **Performance Evaluation:** The project includes evaluation metrics to assess the accuracy and performance of the predictive model.

## Installation

To run the Machine Tool Replacement Model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/AKPANINYANG/Machine-Tool-Replacement-Model.git

2. Install the required dependencies. It is recommended to create a virtual environment and install the dependencies within it:
cd Machine-Tool-Replacement-Model
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate (for Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate' instead)
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Data

The project uses historical data on machine performance and maintenance. Sample data may be included in the repository, but you are encouraged to use your own data for more accurate predictions. The data should be in a structured format, such as CSV, with relevant features such as machine age, maintenance history, and performance metrics.

## Model

The predictive model used in this project is based on machine learning algorithms. The details of the model architecture and algorithms used are available in the source code.

## Evaluation

The performance of the machine tool replacement model can be evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics are used to assess the model's predictive capabilities and make improvements if necessary.
